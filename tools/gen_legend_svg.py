"""Generates the colour swatches and the legend tables in this repo's README.

Standalone generator, not part of the C++ build -- run it manually
(`python3 tools/gen_legend_svg.py`) whenever `BiomePalette` in
coopa/maps/map_config.h changes colour. Requires nothing but the standard library.

It writes two things from one source, which is the whole point of it existing: the
43 swatch files under assets/svg/, and the two markdown tables in README.md that
reference them. A legend is only useful if it is true, and keeping three artefacts
(palette, swatches, README) in agreement by hand across 33 biomes and 10 overlays
is not something anyone does reliably.

`maps_test::test_readme_legend_matches_the_palette` is the other half of the
arrangement: this script makes the three agree, that test proves they still do and
fails the build if they have drifted. Running this on an unchanged palette must
leave the tree byte-identical -- it is deliberately idempotent, so `git diff` after
a run is the check that what is committed matches what the palette says.

The palette is read out of the C++ header by regular expression rather than through
a compiled helper. That is the trade this repo chose: a tiny script with no build
step, against a parser that would break if the header's formatting changed. The
checks in `_parse_*` below exist to make such a break loud and immediate rather
than silent -- a partial run would leave a stale README that the C++ test then
blames on the palette.

"""One swatch.

The outline is a 55%-opacity grey rather than any fixed colour because the same file
has to read on both of GitHub's themes. Without it `snow` (#FFFAFA), `salt_flat`
(#EEEEE6) and `background` (#FFFFFF) are invisible against a white README, and
`bridge` (#706C66) disappears against GitHub's dark background. A translucent
grey darkens the pale ones and lightens the dark ones, so every swatch keeps an edge
either way.

Colours are NOT rendered as inline HTML or as a `#RRGGBB` code alone, which would need
no files at all: GitHub renders its colour chips only in issues, pull requests and
discussions -- never in a README -- and its markdown sanitiser strips both the `style`
attribute and `data:` URIs. Real image files are the only thing that actually shows a
colour in a repository's front page.
