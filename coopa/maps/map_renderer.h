     * pixel for pixel. Region colours are spread around the hue circle by the
     * region pass, so neighbouring provinces are told apart by hue.
     *
     * No ink over the fills -- no borders, no outlines, no shading. That makes
     * the layer readable as *data*: every pixel is either exactly one region's
     * colour or exactly the background, so a consumer can recover which region
     * covers a pixel by looking it up. Country borders used to be stroked over
     * the top in near-black, which broke that property for the 93 k pixels they
     * covered, and read as an artefact besides: a border only exists on a
     * land-to-land edge, so every one of them dangled into the sea instead of
     * closing around its country.
     *
     * Countries are therefore not distinguishable here. `MapCountry` is still in
     * the graph and in `world.yaml` for anyone who needs it, and the composite
     * still tints each cell toward its region colour.
     *
     * Ocean and unclaimed land are left on the background colour rather than
     * given a colour of their own -- there is nothing political about them, and a
     * fill would imply otherwise.

    /**
     * @brief Smooths the finished flat raster, and cuts the rivers back into it.
     *
     * What `ElevationSurface::Blended` actually is. The first attempt decided a
     * blend *per pixel per cell*, pulling the flat height toward the interpolated
     * one near the cell's rim, and that cannot work however it is tuned: every cell
     * independently ramps its own edge, so the map comes out as a field of tiles
     * each wearing a bevel, with a soft halo tracing every outline. It drew the
     * tessellation more clearly than the hard edges it was meant to soften.
     *
     * A blend is not a property of a cell. It is a property of the *image*, so it
     * belongs here, after the rasteriser has put down one flat height per cell and
     * there is a grid to smooth.
     *
     * Three stages, and the order is what makes the rivers survive:
     *
     * 1. `surface_height_()` has already drawn the cells flat and, under this mode
     *    only, **uncut** -- no channel subtracted.
     * 2. Blur the whole raster, the same separable box pass the hillshade uses.
     * 3. Cut the channels in now. A half-cell blur costs an uncut river nothing and
     *    a pre-cut one almost half its contrast -- 15.0 grey levels down to 8.0 --
     *    because a channel a few pixels wide is exactly the feature a blur of that
     *    radius destroys. Cutting afterwards gives back all 15.
     *
     * A radius of 0 returns without touching a pixel, so `elevation_blend = 0` is
     * byte-identical to `ElevationSurface::Flat` rather than merely close to it.
     *
     * ### Varying the radius
     *
     * `elevation_blend_variation` makes stage 2 a *pyramid* instead of one blur:
     * the untouched raster, a blur at the base radius, and a blur at twice it, with
     * `make_blend_field_()` choosing **per cell** where between them to land -- so
     * one cell keeps its hard edges while the cell beside it is fully smoothed.
     *
     * A box blur whose radius genuinely changed per pixel is not one filter but a
     * different one at every pixel, and neighbouring pixels drawing from
     * differently-sized boxes have no reason to agree. Three globally consistent
     * blurs and a feathered weight cannot seam by construction, and cost two passes
     * over the image rather than a different convolution per pixel.
     *
     * Three levels rather than two so the variation is symmetric: a pixel can land
     * either side of the base radius, the mean stays where `elevation_blend` put
     * it, and the knob adds variety rather than sharpening the whole map. At
     * variation 0 the pyramid is not built at all and the single-blur path runs
     * unchanged, byte for byte.
     *
     * @param image The finished elevation raster, smoothed in place.
     * @param graph The map it was drawn from; supplies the cells and their channels.
     * @param config Supplies the surface mode, the blend radius, the variation and
     *        the scale.
     * @param geometry Shared cell outlines, or null to build them locally.
