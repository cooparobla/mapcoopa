 * centre -- only more squares than a village. A role is what lets a reader tell
 * the difference, and what lets a consumer place the right mesh.
 *
 * `Dwelling` is the default and the overwhelming majority; the rest are the civic
 * core, granted by tier and placed nearest the square.
 *
 * Names are append-only, exactly as `Biome`'s are: a role's position is not its
 * identity, but inserting above would silently reinterpret every settlement in
 * every saved map.
