 * @class ShapeField

 *
 * The shape of the world comes from one predicate: `inset()` returns how far
 * inside the outline a point lies. `border_check_()` flags any corner whose inset
 * falls below `border_length`; the water pass forces those cells to sea, and the
 * elevation pass measures height as distance from them -- so this class decides
 * the coastline, the mountains, the regions and the roads, all without any of
 * them knowing shapes exist.
 *
 * It is an object rather than a free function because the organic shapes carry
 * state: a landmass layout drawn from the seed, and a noise generator that warps
 * the coast. Rebuilding those per sample is the exact mistake `Noise` was
 * introduced to undo -- `inset()` is called once per cell *and* once per corner,
 * so it runs on the order of a hundred thousand times per map. Build one field
 * and reuse it; `shape_inset()` is the convenience path for one-off queries.
 *
 * `Rectangle`, `Circle` and `Triangle` are pure geometry and touch neither the
 * layout nor the generator, so constructing a field for them costs nothing.
 *
 * ### Sizing
 *
 * Every dimension treats 0 as "as big as the canvas allows", which is what makes
 * the default rectangle span the grid. `continent_size_m` is the *mean* diameter
 * of a single landmass, so 0 has to mean something per-shape there: a `Continent`
 * grows until its widest lobe just fits the canvas, and an `Archipelago` sizes its
 * landmasses so they cover `k_archipelago_fill` of it between them.
