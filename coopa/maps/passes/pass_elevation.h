     * spans one, so the ordering stays the distance field's and the ridge
     * survives however hard it is attenuated. Mixing toward noise replaces that
     * ordering outright, and at `relief = 1` the interior is shaped by noise

     * - **A coastal mask.** The noise term is faded in over the first
     *   `k_coast_band` of the distance range, so the shore stays the lowest land
     *   there is and a coastline cannot be handed a summit.
     * Land is kept clear of the sea by the split rank remap that follows, not
     * here -- see `redistribute_elevations_()`.
