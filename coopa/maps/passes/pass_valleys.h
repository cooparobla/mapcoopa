/**
 * @class PassValleys
 * @brief Lowers the ground along every watercourse, so rivers sit in valleys.
 *
 * Rivers erode, and this pass is what tells the height field so. Elevation is
 * computed before rivers are routed -- it has to be, the routing follows
 * `MapCorner::downslope` -- so without it the drainage network would be drawn
 * across a surface with nowhere for the water to go: the elevation layer would
 * show no trace of the rivers the water layer is full of, and a mesh built from
 * the data would have rivers running over flat ground.
 *
 * ### A valley, not a channel
 *
 * `MapGraph::elevation_at()` interpolates *cell-site* heights over Delaunay
 * triangles, while rivers run along Voronoi edges -- cell *boundaries*. So
 * lowering corner heights alone would change nothing anyone can see: the cells
 * have to move, and the narrowest feature they can express is about a cell
 * across, 60 m at the default scale, against a river 5 to 20 m wide.
 *
 * That is the right answer regardless. A river sits in a valley far wider than
 * itself, and it is the valley that belongs in a height field -- the channel
 * within it is what `river_width_base_m` draws on the water layer.
 *
 * ### Why it does not simply paint
 *
 * Nothing here paints: dimming rivers into the elevation layer would make it a
 * picture of the terrain rather than the terrain itself, and a consumer flooding
 * a mesh to those values would find channels already cut. The ground is
 * genuinely lower, the water surface `stroke_river_surface_()` draws sits
 * `river_depth_m` above the bed it finds at the bottom of the valley, and
 * flooding a mesh to that surface gives a consistent answer.
