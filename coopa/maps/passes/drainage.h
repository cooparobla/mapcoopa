/**
 * @brief Raises closed basins until every land corner drains to water.
 *
 * The distance-from-coast field is monotone, but nothing after it is: relief
 * noise, the rank remap and the smoothing passes all move corners
 * independently, and any of them can leave a corner lower than every
 * neighbour. Such a corner is a pit, and a downhill walk that reaches one
 * stops on dry land. On a default map 80 of 11 438 land corners were pits,
 * which is why 23 of 55 rivers used to end in the middle of a field.
 *
 * This is the priority-flood fill (Barnes, Lehman & Mulla 2014), which is
 * what DEM processing uses for the same problem. Every corner already at or
 * on water seeds a min-heap; popping the lowest unresolved corner and
 * raising each of its dry neighbours to just above it walks the terrain
 * outward from the sea in ascending order of the height water would have to
 * reach to get there. Each corner is therefore resolved *from* a strictly
 * lower one, and following that chain backwards is a descending path to
 * water. Since steepest descent from any corner also strictly descends, and
 * only a seed can have no lower neighbour, every land corner now drains.
 *
 * The epsilon is what buys strictness rather than a flat spillway, and it is
 * deliberately tiny: chains run a few hundred corners at most, so the total
 * rise is on the order of 1e-4 of the height range -- well under a tenth of
 * a millimetre at the default 600 m. Filling a pit is not a visible change
 * to the terrain; it is the difference between a puddle and a river mouth.
 *
 * Lake corners seed the queue alongside the sea, so an inflow that reaches a
 * lake has arrived and the lake bed is never filled in to force the water
 * onward. That is also what keeps an endorheic basin a lake instead of a
 * river running over its rim.
 *
 * @param graph The graph to fill; reads `adjacent` and rewrites `elevation`.
