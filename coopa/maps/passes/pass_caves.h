/**
 * @class PassCaves
 * @brief Finds the slopes a cave would open on and grows a system down from each.
 *
 * The first feature in the module that exists *below* the ground rather than on
 * it, and the three decisions that make it work are all about staying honest
 * about that.
 *
 * **Where a cave opens.** A cave mouth is a hole in a face of rock, so it belongs
 * on the map's steepest ground -- which in a Voronoi map is an edge with a large
 * height difference across it, and an edge is already the thing that sits
 * *between* two cells. `edge_grade()` ranks them, and the rest of placement is the
 * greedy accept-with-spacing every other placement pass here uses. The mouth sits
 * at the edge's midpoint and the first passage heads from the lower cell toward
 * the higher one, because a cave mouth is something you walk *into* the hill
 * through.
 *
 * **What shape it grows into.** Two regimes, which is what limestone actually
 * does. Above the water table water is falling under gravity: the passage cuts
 * steeply down, stays narrow, branches rarely, and now and then drops a vertical
 * pitch. At and below the water table the water is moving sideways through rock
 * already full of it and attacks every joint it meets, so the passage runs level,
 * opens out and branches freely. One system therefore reads as an entrance series
 * leading to a level network rather than as a uniform tree, and every knob in
 * `CaveConfig` means something physical instead of being a tuning number.
 *
 * **Why it has storeys.** A water table is not fixed. The valley a system drains
 * to cuts down over time and the table follows it, which abandons the network cut
 * at the old level -- leaving it as dry passage -- and starts a new one below.
 * `level_tables_()` works out how many stages a mouth has the relief to support,
 * and growth then runs the same two-regime model once per stage, joining each to
 * the next with the vadose descent that is what a shaft between levels *is*.
 *
 * That is the whole reason the exported floor and roof layers come in pairs. A
 * system cut at one table is a sheet: it can be drawn on a single heightmap and
 * a second adds nothing. Stack three tables `level_spacing_m` apart and the
 * structure stops being expressible in two dimensions, which is the point. The
 * spacing has to stay clear of `chamber_height_m` or the levels touch where they
 * cross and the export merges them back into the sheet they came from.
 *
 * **That it stays underground.** Every station is clamped to
 * `CaveConfig::roof_clearance_m` beneath the terrain, and the clamp is applied
 * *twice*: once as the station is grown, and again on every point of the smoothed
 * passage, because corner-cutting moves points and the smoothed path is the one
 * that gets drawn. The surface it clamps against is the one
 * `MapGraph::elevation_at()` returns with terrain detail and river channels
 * applied -- not the bare control mesh. That distinction is not pedantry:
 * `river_channel_depth_m` alone cuts 18 m out of the drawn surface, so a cave
 * given 25 m of clearance against the mesh has 7 m of rock over it where it
 * crosses under a river, and less than none at a higher `--channel`.
 *
 * Nothing downstream reads caves, so this runs late -- it only needs the
 * *finished* height field, which means after the valley pass, and regions, so it
 * can name itself in the local dialect.

     * here is one of those stages, shallowest first.

     * the deepest table sits exactly where the single table used to, so a system

     * shallowest of them -- a cave whose first table is immediately under its own
     * mouth has no way in.

     * entrance series and the storeys, so raising `level_spacing_m` would have made
     * caves shallower and the two knobs would not have been independent.
