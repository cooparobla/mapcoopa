/**
 * @class PassRoads
 * @brief Fills `MapEdge::road`, `road_class`, `traffic` and `bridge`, and `MapGraph::roads`.
 *
 * Roads are *routed*, not drawn. The pass builds a travel cost for every
 * Delaunay edge out of the terrain either side of it, picks the cells worth
 * connecting, and runs a least-cost path between every pair of them. An edge's
 * `traffic` is the number of those routes that chose it, and its `RoadClass`
 * falls out of that count -- a highway is a highway because everything goes
 * that way, not because anything declared it one.
 *
 * Routes are laid one at a time, longest link first, and each one sees ground
 * an earlier route already built on as `RoadConfig::reuse_discount` times as
 * dear. That single rule is what turns a fan of independent optimal paths into
 * a network: a later route bends to join an existing road rather than cutting
 * its own line a cell away, trunks consolidate, and traffic concentrates enough
 * that the hierarchy means something.
 *
 * ### What this replaces
 *
 * The previous implementation flooded four elevation bands outward from the
 * coast and flagged any edge whose two corners fell in different bands. That
 * traces contour lines, and contour lines connect nothing: a road could run
 * half the map without passing a settlement, every road was the same width, and
 * `TownConfig::road_bonus` was rewarding proximity to a contour rather than to a
 * trade route. The switchbacks that pass produced for free survive here on
 * purpose -- see `RoadConfig::slope_cost`.
 *
 * ### Why it can run before the town pass
 *
 * Towns want roads to score sites by, and good roads want towns to connect,
 * which looks circular. It is not: this pass picks its own anchors with
 * `biome_habitability()` -- the same table `PassTowns` ranks sites with -- so it
 * depends only on biomes and rivers, and the settlements placed two passes later
 * land on the network because both passes are reading the same ground.
 *
 * The pass draws no randomness at all. Terrain decides everything, so there is
 * no stream to seed and nothing to keep in step with another pass.
