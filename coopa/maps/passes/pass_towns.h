 * Sites are scored on where people actually settle: a habitable biome, low
 * ground, and access to the sea, a river or a road. The best-scoring cells are
 * then accepted greedily subject to a minimum separation, so settlements
 * spread across a continent instead of clustering on the single best river
 * mouth. Buildings are packed into the accepted cell by scanning a grid and
 * keeping any footprint that lies wholly inside the polygon.

 * The original left this pass as a stub that logged its own name, with a
 * commented-out sketch of the packing step referencing types that never
 * existed. The scoring and placement here are new; the packing follows that
 * sketch's ray-cast containment test.
